Nova font
=========


Here is the Nova font designed by `Wojciech Kalinowski
<http://luc.devroye.org/fonts-57186.html>`_ and downloaded from the
`Font Library <https://fontlibrary.org/en/font/nova>`_.
It has nice symmetric glyphs, such as "p" and "d", and "m" and "w".

--------------------------------------------------

Designed with FontForge, Nova ttf files trigger the above errors of
pdfTeX, as described in https://tex.stackexchange.com/a/225089.
These files have been "fixed" with FontForge following Reuben Thomas'
comment to that answer.
